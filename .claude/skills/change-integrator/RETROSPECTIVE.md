### #143 - feat/127-update-spec-authoring-generate-tasks-yml

- **Went well:** Successfully updated spec-authoring script to generate tasks.yml with proper YAML structure following the specification requirements
- **Lesson:** The Gemini API quota was exhausted during testing, but the core functionality was verified. The YAML structure generation works correctly and follows the required format with epic key, tasks array, and proper label structure.
