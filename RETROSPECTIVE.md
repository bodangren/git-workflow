## Sprint 1

### #3 - TASK 1: Restructure Existing Skill

- **Went well:** The process of renaming the directory and trimming the skill files was straightforward. The focused scope of the task was clear and easy to execute.
- **Friction:** I initially made a mistake by attempting to modify the `.claude/skills/` directory instead of the correct `skills/` source directory. The user's clarification was essential to get back on track.
- **Lesson:** Always confirm the source-of-truth directory for skill development before making file system changes. The `skills/` directory is for development, while `.claude/skills/` is for the final installed version. This distinction is critical.
