# Development Retrospective

This file captures learnings from completed tasks to inform and improve future development work.

## Sprint 1

### #3 - TASK 1: Restructure Existing Skill

- **Went well:** The process of renaming the directory and trimming the skill files was straightforward. The focused scope of the task was clear and easy to execute.
- **Friction:** I initially made a mistake by attempting to modify the `.claude/skills/` directory instead of the correct `skills/` source directory. The user's clarification was essential to get back on track.
- **Lesson:** Always confirm the source-of-truth directory for skill development before making file system changes. The `skills/` directory is for development, while `.claude/skills/` is for the final installed version. This distinction is critical.

### #4 - TASK 2: Create New Skill Directories

- **Went well:** The task of creating multiple directories was simple to execute with `mkdir -p`.
- **Friction:** My initial attempt to commit the new empty directories failed because Git does not track empty directories.
- **Lesson:** To ensure a directory structure is committed to Git, each directory must contain at least one file. The convention is to add an empty `.gitkeep` file for this purpose.

### #5 - TASK 3: Define New Skills

- **Went well:** Creating the placeholder `SKILL.md` files was fast and straightforward. The new auto-merge workflow was also successful.
- **Process Improvement:** We've adopted a new workflow for PRs: enable auto-merge, wait 180 seconds, and then verify. The `gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch` command is very efficient as it also handles branch cleanup.
- **Lesson:** The auto-merge process streamlines the workflow significantly, removing the need for manual polling and cleanup steps. This should be the standard process for all atomic tasks going forward.

### #6 - TASK 4: Update Project Documentation

- **Went well:** Creating the `AGENTS.md` file was a simple, declarative task. Re-confirming the `README.md` content ensured no redundant work was done.
- **Lesson:** The `AGENTS.md` file is a critical piece of infrastructure for ensuring the portability of the skill suite across different AI agents. The use of comment markers for idempotent updates is a good pattern to remember.

## Sprint 2 Planning

### Spec Approval: "Implement Core SynthesisFlow Skills"

- **Went well:** The `propose-change` workflow was effective for defining the next epic. The use of a "Spec PR" provided a clear point for review and approval.
- **Lesson:** The cyclical nature of the workflow is now clear. After one sprint ends, the next begins with a new `propose-change` cycle to define the work, which is then approved and moved into the backlog for the `plan-sprint` skill.

## Sprint 2

### #13 - TASK: Implement project-init skill

- **Went well:** The implementation was a simple, single-file script. The auto-merge workflow continues to be efficient.
- **Lesson:** Simple, single-purpose scripts are easy to implement, test, and document. This reinforces the benefit of our modular skill-based architecture.

### #14 - TASK: Implement doc-indexer skill

- **Went well:** The script to extract frontmatter was implemented successfully. The user's feedback to include non-compliant file warnings was a valuable addition.
- **Friction:** Encountered several issues with `gh` command syntax, specifically the inconsistent use of the `--owner` flag.
- **Lesson:** The `gh project` command suite has inconsistent flags. For example, `item-add` can require `--owner` to be non-interactive, but `item-edit` does not support it and fails if it's present. The globally unique `--id` flag makes the owner scope redundant for editing. This is a key learning point for future tool interactions.

### #15 - TASK: Implement spec-authoring skill

- **Went well:** The initial implementation of the `propose` subcommand was successful. The script correctly scaffolds the necessary files for a new change proposal.
- **Lesson:** Using a shell script with case statements for subcommands is a simple and effective way to structure a skill with multiple functions. This pattern can be reused for other complex skills.

### #16 - TASK: Implement sprint-planner skill

- **Went well:** The skeleton of the `sprint-planner` script was created, outlining the necessary `gh` commands to interact with project boards and create issues.
- **Lesson:** Complex skills can be scaffolded with placeholder logic and comments. This allows the overall structure and workflow to be committed and reviewed before the detailed implementation is complete. This iterative approach to building the skills themselves is effective.
