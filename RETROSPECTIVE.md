# Development Retrospective

This file captures learnings from completed tasks to inform and improve future development work.

## Sprint 1

### #3 - TASK 1: Restructure Existing Skill

- **Went well:** The process of renaming the directory and trimming the skill files was straightforward. The focused scope of the task was clear and easy to execute.
- **Friction:** I initially made a mistake by attempting to modify the `.claude/skills/` directory instead of the correct `skills/` source directory. The user's clarification was essential to get back on track.
- **Lesson:** Always confirm the source-of-truth directory for skill development before making file system changes. The `skills/` directory is for development, while `.claude/skills/` is for the final installed version. This distinction is critical.

### #4 - TASK 2: Create New Skill Directories

- **Went well:** The task of creating multiple directories was simple to execute with `mkdir -p`.
- **Friction:** My initial attempt to commit the new empty directories failed because Git does not track empty directories.
- **Lesson:** To ensure a directory structure is committed to Git, each directory must contain at least one file. The convention is to add an empty `.gitkeep` file for this purpose.
