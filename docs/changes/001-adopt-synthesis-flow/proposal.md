# Proposal: Adopt SynthesisFlow

This proposal outlines the adoption of 'SynthesisFlow', a new modular, spec-driven development methodology, for this repository. It synthesizes best practices from `git-workflow`, `BMAD`, `OpenSpec`, and `spec-kit` to create a comprehensive, end-to-end workflow for AI-driven development.

The goal is to replace the monolithic `git-workflow` skill with a more robust and modular suite of skills that provide greater clarity, better state management via GitHub Projects, and a more rigorous specification approval process.
